# RealTimeRenderingProject

This project aimed to teach me how to create a complex and crowded 3D nature scene that runs in real-time as a standalone application on the Meta Quest 3.

Details of what I learned and did can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19zgXqBGBtCI8QF0kY2ZxtkgaOZHDbOwa8XfBxjgB62M/edit?usp=sharing
